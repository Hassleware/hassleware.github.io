    <h3>#35</h3>
    <p>This piece shows a redraw of a character I originally created when I was about 11, updated to match my current style. I wanted the newer version to feel more imposing and believable, while keeping the idea of the ruby artefact powering its sight from the original design.</p>
    
    <h3>Process &amp; inspiration</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Compared early and current work</li>
        <li>Used anatomy references</li>
        <li>Focused on lighting and shadow placement</li>
        <li>Shows improvement in structure and confidence</li>
    </ul>
