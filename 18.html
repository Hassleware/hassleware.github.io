    <p>This drawing was mainly an anatomy and shading study of a dragon-like humanoid creature. I wanted the background to feel like a solar system, but more abstract than realistic.</p>
    
    <h3>Process &amp; inspiration</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Practised humanoid anatomy with creature features</li>
        <li>Explored abstract backgrounds</li>
        <li>Focused on shading rather than fine detail</li>
        <li>Experimented with scale and atmosphere</li>
    </ul>
