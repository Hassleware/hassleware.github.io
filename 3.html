    <h3>#3</h3>
    <p>I designed these demons to see if they could fit into the world of DOOM, which has very hostile and aggressive enemy designs. I chose to pose one of them sitting down to suggest intelligence and awareness beyond pure rage or instinct.</p>
    
    <h3>Process &amp; inspiration</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Inspired by DOOM enemy designs and atmosphere</li>
        <li>Designed original creatures rather than copying existing demons</li>
        <li>Experimented with body language to imply intelligence</li>
        <li>Focused on silhouettes and hostile shapes</li>
    </ul>
