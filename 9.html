    <p>I drew Arishem from Marvel’s Eternals because his design stood out to me as both mechanical and deeply alien at the same time. I really enjoyed this piece because getting the lighting and shading accurate to the film pushed my skills.</p>

        <li>Inspired by Arishem’s scale and presence in Eternals</li>

        <li>Practised controlled shading to match a cinematic reference</li>
