    <h3>#37</h3>
    <p>This piece is a revisit and redraw of my Eastern inspired dragon design shown previously. I wanted to develop the original idea further and push it toward a more detailed and refined creature, while keeping the long, serpentine body that interested me in the first version.</p>
    
    <h3>Process &amp; inspiration</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Ongoing redraw and refinement</li>
        <li>Focus on surface texture and scale</li>
        <li>Planned environmental background</li>
        <li>Shows development rather than final polish</li>
    </ul>
