    <h3>#37</h3>
    <p>Like the previous piece, this is a redraw of a creature I designed when I was younger. I’m still developing it, with plans to add more dragon-like scales, finish the shading, and include a detailed mountain range in the background.</p>
    
    <h3>Process &amp; inspiration</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Ongoing redraw and refinement</li>
        <li>Focus on surface texture and scale</li>
        <li>Planned environmental background</li>
        <li>Shows development rather than final polish</li>
    </ul>
