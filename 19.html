    <p>This dragon was my attempt to create something that feels faithful to classic dragon designs while still having unique features. I added a magma-like colour gradient and an armour-style skull to make it feel powerful and distinct.</p>
    
    <h3>Process &amp; inspiration</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Inspired by traditional dragon anatomy</li>
        <li>Added magma textures to suggest heat and strength</li>
        <li>Designed the skull to feel armoured and aggressive</li>
        <li>Focused on balancing familiar and original elements</li>
    </ul>
