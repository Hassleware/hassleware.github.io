    <p>Like earlier pieces in this portfolio, I wanted to practise obscuring a character while still making it feel powerful and 3D. I imagined this creature as an alien gladiator standing in a nearly pitch-black arena.</p>
    
    <h3>Process &amp; inspiration</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Focused on lighting and partial visibility</li>
        <li>Used stance and posture to imply combat skill</li>
        <li>Inspired by artists such as Matt Frank and Bill Couturié</li>
        <li>Practised making a character feel dynamic without fully revealing it</li>
    </ul>
