    <p>For this version of Nurgle, I went for a more symbolic, mural-like style. I wanted it to feel like something ancient, carved or worshipped rather than a literal depiction.</p>
    
    <h3>Process &amp; inspiration</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Used dithering to create a darker, engraved texture</li>
        <li>Aimed for a cave painting or religious mural feel</li>
        <li>Designed it as if it was created by followers or creatures that worship Nurgle</li>
        <li>Focused on symbolism over realism</li>
    </ul>
