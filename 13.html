    <h3>#13</h3>
    <p>This piece contains concepts for aliens that travel through space and destroy worlds. I like the ideas in it, but I would develop it further if I revisited it.</p>
    
    <h3>Process &amp; inspiration</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Focused on hostile, cosmic themes</li>
        <li>Explored large-scale destruction</li>
        <li>Would add colour to better highlight their alien nature</li>
        <li>Early concept exploration rather than a finished piece</li>
    </ul>
