    <h3>#22</h3>
    <p>For this piece, I challenged myself to make something dynamic while only using two colours. I wanted to see how much movement and impact I could create with limited colour.</p>
    
    <h3>Process &amp; inspiration</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Restricted colour palette</li>
        <li>Focused on motion and composition</li>
        <li>Practised visual clarity through contrast</li>
        <li>Explored simplicity over detail</li>
    </ul>
