    <p>I thought the idea of drawing Kermit the Frog as a bodybuilder was funny, so I decided to draw it. It was a light-hearted piece that let me practise exaggerated anatomy.</p>
    
    <h3>Process &amp; inspiration</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Humorous character reinterpretation</li>
        <li>Practised exaggerated muscle forms</li>
        <li>Focused on expression and pose</li>
        <li>Balanced fun with technical study</li>
    </ul>
