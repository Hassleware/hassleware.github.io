    <h3>#23</h3>
    <p>This is a mural-style interpretation of Tzeentch from Warhammer 40,000. He stood out to me as a clever, manipulative, and malicious character rather than a purely physical threat.</p>
    
    <h3>Process &amp; inspiration</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Inspired by religious murals and symbolic art</li>
        <li>Focused on intelligence and manipulation over brute force</li>
        <li>Used stylised shapes instead of realism</li>
        <li>Designed it to feel worshipped and feared</li>
    </ul>
