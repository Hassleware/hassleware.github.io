    <p>I wanted to design an alien that feels completely overwhelming in strength. I used exaggerated musculature and white fire to show extreme heat and power.</p>
    
    <h3>Process &amp; inspiration</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Explored scale and dominance</li>
        <li>Used white fire to suggest extreme heat</li>
        <li>Focused on physical presence</li>
        <li>Practised dramatic silhouettes</li>
    </ul>
