    <h3>#12</h3>
    <p>For this creature, I combined a Komodo dragon with elements inspired by a silverback gorilla. The creature it is facing is a more human-like hybrid of the same species.</p>
    
    <h3>Process &amp; inspiration</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Explored mixing animal anatomy</li>
        <li>Focused on longer arms and physical strength</li>
        <li>Designed contrasting silhouettes within the same species</li>
        <li>Practised creature interaction and scale</li>
    </ul>
