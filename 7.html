    <h3>#7</h3>
    <p>This is my interpretation of Nurgle from Warhammer 40,000. I imagined him in front of a cauldron, endlessly trying to create the perfect disease, to show his cosmic power and complete indifference to life.</p>
    
    <h3>Process &amp; inspiration</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Inspired by Nurgle as the embodiment of decay and stagnation</li>
        <li>Focused on scale and presence rather than action</li>
        <li>Designed the pose to feel calm and patient rather than aggressive</li>
        <li>Wanted him to feel inevitable, not emotional</li>
    </ul>
