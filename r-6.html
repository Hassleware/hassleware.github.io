    <p>I wanted to design a dragon-like creature that felt imposing without relying on more generic Western dragon traits. I leaned more toward Eastern dragon design, with a longer, snake-like body and dinosaur-inspired features.</p>
    
    <h3>Process &amp; inspiration</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Influenced by Eastern dragon designs</li>
        <li>Emphasised serpentine anatomy</li>
        <li>Avoided overused fantasy elements</li>
        <li>Combined dragons with dinosaurs</li>
    </ul>
