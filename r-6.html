    <p>I enjoyed working on this piece because drawing female anatomy makes me rely less on heavy bulk and more on proportion, balance and posture to make the character convincing. I also checked the figure using the traditional heads tall proportion method to keep the anatomy believable.</p>

    <p>The design takes some influence from characters such as Chell from Portal and Lara Croft from Tomb Raider. Their builds feel more agile and controlled, which suited the idea of a character equipped for light war gear where endurance and precision matter more than raw strength. If I revisit the character, I would place her in a less hostile but still practical environment, or redesign her with fuller military armour to reflect battlefield use rather than an expedition setting.</p>
