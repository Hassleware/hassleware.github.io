    <p>This is a dragon like creature I designed when I was younger. I wanted it to feel imposing without relying on more generic Western dragon traits, so I leaned more toward Eastern dragon design with a longer snake like body and dinosaur inspired features. This piece represents my early interest in creature design and experimenting with different influences.</p>
