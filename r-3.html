    <h3>#33</h3>
    <p>This piece was meant to show a UFO flying over a mountain range at sunset in a stylised way. Looking back, it now feels more like a crash scene because of the fiery colour coming from the craft, which I think changes the mood in an interesting way.</p>
    
    <h3>Process &amp; inspiration</h3>

        <li>Stylised rather than realistic approach</li>
