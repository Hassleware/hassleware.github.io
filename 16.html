    <h3>#16</h3>
    <p>For this piece, I wanted to practise silhouette art by showing a monster fighter purely through shape and posture. I focused on making it feel ready for combat, like it’s bracing itself to face whatever comes next.</p>
    
    <h3>Process &amp; inspiration</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Practised strong silhouettes</li>
        <li>Used clenched fists and stance to imply strength</li>
        <li>Focused on readability without interior detail</li>
        <li>Explored how much emotion can come from pose alone</li>
    </ul>
