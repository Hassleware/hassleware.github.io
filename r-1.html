    <h3>#31</h3>
    <p>This painting of the sun was inspired by another artist’s work that I liked. I wanted to show space as something dynamic and alive rather than cold or empty, using the movement of solar flares to give it energy.</p>
    
    <h3>Process &amp; inspiration</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Inspired by space art that focuses on motion</li>
        <li>Focused on warm colours and shifting forms</li>
        <li>Explored how light can change the mood of space</li>
        <li>Practised painting energy rather than realism</li>
    </ul>
