    <h3>#24</h3>
    <p>This sketch represents a monster based around vanity and consuming the souls of those who worship it. I used a black hole to symbolise how obsession and ego can lead to destruction.</p>
    
    <h3>Process &amp; inspiration</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Symbolic rather than literal design</li>
        <li>Used a cave-like setting for atmosphere</li>
        <li>Black hole represents loss and consumption</li>
        <li>Explored moral themes through creature design</li>
    </ul>
