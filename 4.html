    <h3>#4</h3>
    <p>This kaiju design is heavily inspired by Shin Godzilla (2016). What stood out to me was the theme of adaptation and the sense that the creature is shaped by violence. I tried to reflect that through scarring and colour.</p>
    
    <h3>Process &amp; inspiration</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Influenced by Shin Godzilla’s themes of evolution and destruction</li>
        <li>Used deep reds to emphasise pain, hostility, and violence</li>
        <li>Focused on texture and damage to suggest history and suffering</li>
        <li>Designed the creature to feel unstable and dangerous</li>
    </ul>
