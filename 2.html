    <h3>#2</h3>
    <p>This is my interpretation of the Tyranids from Warhammer 40,000. I wanted them to feel unstoppable and almost bored by destruction, like consuming everything is just routine to them. I tried to show this through their scale, posture, and lack of emotion.</p>
    
    <h3>Process &amp; inspiration</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Inspired by the Tyranids’ lore and design language</li>
        <li>Used multiple jaws to represent endless hunger</li>
        <li>Included a hand gripping the Earth to show their power and dominance</li>
        <li>Focused on making them feel alien and overwhelming rather than aggressive</li>
    </ul>
