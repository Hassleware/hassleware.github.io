    <p>This drawing is a style study where I drew Pepe the Frog as Broly from Dragon Ball Super. I wanted to practise the style because Akira Toriyama is a big inspiration for me.</p>
    
    <h3>Process &amp; inspiration</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Studied Toriyama’s art style</li>
        <li>Practised exaggerated anatomy</li>
        <li>Combined humour with action</li>
        <li>Focused on line work and expression</li>
    </ul>
