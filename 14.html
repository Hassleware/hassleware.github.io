    <p>I wanted to create the feeling of an ancient rock statue in a dark, abandoned environment. This piece shows a small section of the ruins of an alien civilisation.</p>
    
    <h3>Process &amp; inspiration</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Inspired by ancient ruins and lost civilisations</li>
        <li>Focused on atmosphere and scale</li>
        <li>Used darkness to imply unseen structures</li>
        <li>Designed to feel old, forgotten, and imposing</li>
    </ul>
