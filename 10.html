    <h3>#10</h3>
    <p>This piece is a reimagining of Dave Blunts as a mastermind character who gains power through what he consumes. I paired that idea with a technological throne to show a sense of ascension and control.</p>
    
    <h3>Process &amp; inspiration</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Experimental character concept</li>
        <li>Combined humour with a darker sci-fi tone</li>
        <li>Designed the throne to suggest power and authority</li>
        <li>If I revisited this piece, I would add more detail to the lower half of the throne</li>
    </ul>
