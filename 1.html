    <h3>#1</h3>
    <p>I made this piece to practice lighting while hiding most of the character’s design. I wanted to see if I could still make the monster feel 3D and have depth, even though it’s a 2D drawing. By keeping most of the body in shadow and focusing on the face, I tried to guide where the viewer looks and control the mood.</p>
    <h3>Process &amp; inspiration</h3>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Focus:</strong> lighting, depth, and atmosphere</li>
    <li>Experimented with obscuring form using shadow</li>
    <li>Inspired by a comic book shading tutorial that showed how lighting can completely change the feel of a character</li>
    <li><strong>Goal:</strong> improve how I convey 3D form in 2D art</li>
    </ul>
