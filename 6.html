    <p>This is my interpretation of the Void Dragon from Warhammer 40,000. I wanted it to feel like a living mechanical city rather than just a creature, with a sense of intelligence and agency behind it. I also tried to make it more traditionally dragon-like compared to the official model.</p>
    
    <h3>Process &amp; inspiration</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Inspired by the Void Dragon and the Necrons from Warhammer 40,000</li>
        <li>Designed it as an underground mechanical city made of bunker-like structures</li>
        <li>Used glowing green lights as eyes to imply awareness and consciousness</li>
        <li>Focused on scale, power, and the idea of something immense being trapped</li>
        <li>Intentionally avoided blocky, modern military shapes by using sharper, more angular sci-fi forms</li>
        <li>This piece is unfinished and I plan to push it further with more detail and refinement</li>
    </ul>
