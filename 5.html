    <p>I created this alien to see if I could design something that felt powerful and threatening while still being believable anatomically. I wanted it to look alien, but still grounded enough to fit into a sci-fi action setting like Invincible.</p>
    
    <h3>Process &amp; inspiration</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Inspired by Invincible and its more monstrous characters</li>
        <li>Focused on muscular scale and physical power rather than weapons</li>
        <li>Tried to balance alien anatomy with believable muscle structure</li>
        <li>If I revisited this piece, I would add more shading and colour</li>
    </ul>
