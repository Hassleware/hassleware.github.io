    <p>This is a sketch of Shin Godzilla in a side-on view, inspired by the style of The Art of Shin Godzilla concept book. I wanted it to feel like early development art rather than a finished illustration.</p>
    
    <h3>Process &amp; inspiration</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Inspired by Shin Godzilla’s themes of adaptation</li>
        <li>Focused on silhouette and form</li>
        <li>Studied the visual language of the concept art book</li>
        <li>Explored how small changes can give Godzilla a fresh identity</li>
    </ul>
