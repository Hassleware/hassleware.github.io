    <p>This is a sketch of the Exo Mech Ares from the Terraria Calamity mod, which I drew for a friend. I enjoyed the challenge of translating a metallic, pixel-art design into a hand-drawn sketch.</p>
    
    <h3>Process &amp; inspiration</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Inspired by game mod design</li>
        <li>Practised metallic textures</li>
        <li>Focused on scale and structure</li>
        <li>Planned further development (limbs and deeper shading)</li>
    </ul>
